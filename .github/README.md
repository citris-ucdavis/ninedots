The Nine Dots puzzle, built on the Visual Thinking `GeneralPuzzle` puzzle template, presents a set of nine dots in a square grid and instructs the player to draw (with a laser pointer) a series of connected line segments such that all nine dots are covered. At first, the player is challenged to do this with a maximum of four line segments. Next, with a maximum of three. Finally, the player is asked to consider how this feat might be accomplished with only a single line segment.
